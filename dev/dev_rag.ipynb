    "AI answer: That's a prudent inquiry!  Many banks offer attractive interest rates on savings accounts, but they may stipulate a minimum balance requirement.  Failing to maintain this minimum can trigger various consequences, including incurring fees or forfeiting the advertised interest rate. Carefully review the minimum balance stipulation within the T&Cs to ensure it aligns with your financial situation.\n",

To mitigate these risks, ensure your mobile device is equipped with a strong password and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for banking activities. Your bank's security notifications serve as a valuable reminder to prioritize online safety measures.\n",
