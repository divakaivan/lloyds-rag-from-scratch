We will pay your interest ‘gross’, this means we will not deduct tax automatically from it. Depending on your personal  circumstances you may need to pay tax on the interest you earn. You will be responsible for paying any tax you may owe  to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). We provide a range of exclusive offers on banking products to our Club Lloyds customers. You can find details about them  and the conditions that apply at: lloydsbank.com/clublloyds in our UK branches or by phoning us on 0345 300 0000.  These banking offers may change from time to time.  A Club Lloyds Account holder can also choose from a range of Lifestyle Benefits. These are described in the Club Lloyds  welcome pack. Only one Lifestyle Benefit can be chosen for each account. These benefits are provided by different  third-party suppliers, through the administrator Blackhawk Network EMEA Limited, PO Box 1586, Westside, London Road,  Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, HP1\\xa09SF. Company Registration number 4155659. The supplier\\'s terms and conditions will apply to each Lifestyle Benefit. The conditions explain how the supplier   and administrator can make changes to them. After opening your Club Lloyds Account or adding Club Lloyds to your Added Value Account , you will receive a welcome  letter or email. This will contain the terms and conditions of each of the benefits and how to select them. If you do not  receive this email or letter within 14\\xa0days, please contact Blackhawk Network EMEA Limited on 0345\\xa0303\\xa00303 or  +44\\xa01733\\xa0462\\xa0224 if calling from abroad (8am – 8pm, Monday to Saturday, 9am – 6pm Sundays and bank holidays).  You\\xa0can also use this number to choose your Lifestyle Benefit if you have not done so already. You have 30\\xa0days from  the date the account is opened or you add Club Lloyds to select the benefit you wish to receive. Your chosen benefit  will start at the end of this period. The benefit you select will apply for a year. If you make your choice more than 30\\xa0days  after opening the account or adding Club Lloyds, then it will be fulfilled on a pro-rata basis. For example, if you make your  Lifestyle Benefit selection 6\\xa0months after the end of the 30-day selection period, the Lifestyle Benefit you choose will only  be valid for the remaining 6\\xa0months of the benefit year. 30\\xa0days before the end of the benefit period, you will be given  the option to change the benefit. If you wish to change your benefit you must do so within 30\\xa0days. If you choose not to  change your benefit, then your existing benefit will be automatically renewed for another year.  The benefit option selected will continue for as long as: • the Club Lloyds Account remains open; or  • you have Club Lloyds added to an Added Value Account; and  • the Club Lloyds fee continues to be paid or conditions for the fee to be waived are met You can\\'t combine Lifestyle Benefits with any other offer or exchange them for cash or other alternatives. The range   of Lifestyle Benefits available may change from time to time. We will tell you if we make changes to the range of   Lifestyle Benefits.

Account fees The information below in the sections 'Withdrawing cash', 'Buying goods or services in a foreign currency' and 'Other services' apply to personal current accounts and savings accounts (if your savings accounts offer the relevant card  or services). Withdrawing cash If you take money in pounds from your account using any Lloyds Bank or Bank of Scotland cash machine in the UK, we won't charge you for the withdrawal. If you use any other cash machine you may be charged by the machine owner. The machine will show you the amount and tell you it will be taken from your account when you withdraw the cash. Paying-in cash using a machine You can pay cash into your account at one of our branches using a Lloyds Bank or Bank of Scotland Immediate Deposit Machine or one of our cash machines that accept cash deposits. We won’t charge you for this deposit. If you pay cash into your account away from our branches using an Automated Deposit Machine, you may be charged by the machine owner. The machine will show you the amount and tell you it will be taken from your account when you deposit the cash. Cash withdrawal in a foreign currency, or cash withdrawal in pounds outside the UK (at a cash machine or over the counter) If you use your card to: • withdraw cash in a foreign currency, or • withdraw cash in pounds outside the UK, then unless you've asked the cash machine or card terminal provider to do the currency conversion, the card payment scheme, for example, Visa, will convert the amount into pounds the day the transaction is processed using their exchange rate. In Visa's case this will be the Visa Payment Scheme Exchange Rate. The symbol on your card will tell you which payment scheme applies. You can check the payment scheme exchange rate for your card online at: lloydsbank.com/ travel/using-debit-credit-cards-abroad We will charge you a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99% of the pounds payment amount. This is a fee for currency conversion. We will also charge a foreign currency cash fee of £1.50 for each withdrawal. In some countries, the cash machine or card terminal you use may offer you the option of paying for the transaction in pounds. If you choose to pay in pounds, the exchange rate will generally be provided by the cash machine operator or card terminal provider. In this instance, we will not charge you a foreign currency transaction fee, but we will charge a foreign cash fee of £1.50 for each withdrawal.\",\n",
