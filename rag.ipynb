Failing to maintain this minimum can trigger various consequences, including incurring fees or forfeiting the advertised interest rate. Carefully review the minimum balance stipulation within the T&Cs to ensure it aligns with your financial situation.\n",

To mitigate these risks, ensure your mobile device is equipped with a strong password and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for banking activities.
